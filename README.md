In this repository, I have attached several ready-to-use codes for my experiments in precision agriculture and remote sensing:

Code 1 (DMS to XY Conversion): This code converts GPS data from Degree Minute Second (DMS) format to XY coordinates, enabling further spatial analysis such as mapping through Kriging or IDW interpolation.

Code 2: Used to generate distribution maps for fertilizer prescriptions and visualize vegetation data based on multispectral imaging.

Code 3 (NMEA to DMS Conversion): Converts GPS data from NMEA format to DMS, preparing it for further geographic processing.

Code 4: Generates heatmaps for spatial data representation, useful in visualizing variations in crop health or soil properties.

Code 5 (Multispectral Image Denoising): Applied to remove environmental noise from multispectral imagery using Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE), enhancing image clarity for analysis.

Code 6: Creates stack graphs for data visualization. The data can easily be replaced, allowing the code to be reused for various datasets.

Code 7 (Shapefile Creation and Reflectance Extraction): This code utilizes shapefiles created in ArcGIS from UAV orthomosaics to extract reflectance values for specific regions of interest.

Code 8 (Multispectral Image Reflectance Extraction): Extracts reflectance data from multispectral images, enabling the analysis of crop health, soil properties, and more
